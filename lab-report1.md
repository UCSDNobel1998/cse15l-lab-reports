# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
## Commands
**cd**
* *an example of using the command with no arguments:*
  
```
# Command and output
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
```
1. When the command was run, I was in the home directory.
2. The reason why I got that output is that when I use the command with no arguments, it changes my current working directory to my home directory. It is a convention to help users navigate back to the home directory.
3. The output is not an error.
  
* *an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument:*
```
# Command and output
[user@sahara ~]$ cd ~/lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ pwd
/home/lecture1
```
1. When the command was run, I was in the lecture1 directory.
2. The reason why I got that output is that when I use the command with the path to a directory, this changes my current working directory to the corresponding directory.
3. The output is not an error.

*  *an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument:*
```
# Command and output
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd messages/Hello.java
bash: cd: messages/Hello.java: No such file or directory
```
1. When the command was run, I was still in the lecture1 directory.
2. The reason why I got that output is that when I use the command with the path to a file, an error occurs.
3. An error occurs because cd changes the working directory, and it expects the path to a directory, not a file.

**ls**
* *an example of using the command with no arguments:*
```
# Command and output
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ ls
Hello.class  Hello.java  messages  README
```
1. When the command was run, I was in the lecture1 directory.
2. The reason why I got that output is that when I use the command with no argument, it lists the content in the current working directory.
3. The output is not an error.

```

[user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ ls en-us.txt
en-us.txt
```

1. When the command was run, I was in the messages directory.
2. The reason why I got that output is that when I use the command with the path to a file, it lists the name of the file.
3. The output is not an error and it shows the information about that file, including its name.

**cat**
* *an example of using the command with no arguments:*
```
# Command and output
[user@sahara ~]$ cat
hello
hello
```

1. When the command was run, I was in the home directory.
2. The reason why I got that output is that when I use the command with no arguments, it waits for the user to provide the input from the keyboard.
3. The output is not an error.

*  *an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument:*
```
# Command and output
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cat messages
cat: messages: Is a directory
```
1. When the command was run, I was in the lecture1 directory.
2. The reason why I got that output is that when I use the command with the path to a directory, an error occurs.
3. The output is an error because **'cat'** is  designed to work with files, not directories.
